An Internet of Things (IoT) system for fire detection is a network of devices that are connected to the internet and equipped with sensors to detect the presence of fire. These sensors can be connected to a central hub or gateway, which receives the data from the sensors and processes it to determine if a fire has been detected. If a fire is detected, the system can take a variety of actions, such as sending an alert to the appropriate authorities, activating a fire suppression system, or sending a notification to a designated person or group. The use of an IoT system for fire detection can help to quickly identify and respond to fires, potentially reducing the risk of damage or injury.
